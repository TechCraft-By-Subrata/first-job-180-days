# 🚀 First Software Developer Job in 180 Days

**A discipline-driven, build-in-public path to crack your first job**

## 👋 Read This First (Important)

This repository is **not a course**, **not a bootcamp**, and **not a shortcut**.

This is for people who are:

* Tired of being confused
* Willing to commit daily
* Ready to be judged by output, not certificates

If you’re looking for motivation, skip this repo.
If you’re looking for **direction and accountability**, continue reading.

## ❓ Why This Exists

Millions invest **18–20 years in education**, yet struggle to land their **first job**.

What follows is predictable:

* Self-doubt
* Family pressure
* Mental fatigue
* Loss of confidence

I decided to intervene—not with theory, but with **execution**.

This repo documents a **180-day system** that focuses on:

* Building real skills
* Creating public proof of work
* Standing out from the resume pile

---

## 🎯 The Goal

By the end of 180 days, you will have:

* A visible body of work
* Real-world projects
* Public learning history
* Confidence to face interviews
* Proof that you didn’t just “learn”—you **built**

> **Actions will speak louder than your resume.**

---

## 🧭 How This Works

* You work daily (consistency > intensity)
* You build in public
* You document progress
* You reflect weekly
* You improve continuously

No deadlines imposed by me.
The discipline is **yours**.

---

## 🛠️ What We Will Do (High Level)

* Fundamentals (no skipping)
* Practical problem-solving
* Project-based learning
* Writing & documentation
* Public visibility (GitHub, LinkedIn)

No certificates.
No fake guarantees.

## 📆 The 180-Day Breakdown

```
/weeks
  /week-01-foundations
  /week-02-core-skills

  ...
  /week-26-job-ready
```

Each week focuses on:

## 🧪 Build in Public (Non-Negotiable)

Private learning creates **private confidence**.
Public learning creates **opportunity**.

You will:

* Push code regularly
* Write progress notes
* Share learnings openly
* Accept feedback

---

## ⚠️ Who Should NOT Join This

This repo is **not** for you if:

* You want shortcuts
* You want guarantees
* You can’t commit daily
* You disappear when it gets hard
* You blame circumstances more than actions

This path is demanding—by design.

---

## 🤝 What I Expect From You

* Honesty
* Consistency
* Discipline
* Trust in the process
* Respect for time (yours and mine)

I give guidance.
You give execution.

## 📈 How Success Is Measured

Not by:
❌ Certificates
❌ Course completion
❌ Hours watched

But by:
✅ Code written
✅ Projects shipped
✅ Problems solved
✅ Growth documented

---

## 📣 Final Note

I’m not promising a job.
I’m promising a **process that gives you a fighting chance**.

If you stay committed for 180 days,
you will **not be the same person** who started.
